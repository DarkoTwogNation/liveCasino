        or otherwise have the right to grant the license set forth in this Section; and the posting of your User Content

        you post to or through the Services. THE COMPANY SHALL BE ENTITLED TO UNRESTRICTED USE OF ANY USER CONTENT IT

      <p> You understand that by using the Services, you may be exposed to User Content created by others that is
        offensive, indecent or objectionable. The Company does not endorse or have control over what is posted as User
        Content. User
        Content is not reviewed by the Company prior to posting and does not reflect the opinions or policies of the
        Company. The Company makes no representations or warranties, express or implied as to the User Content or the
        accuracy
        and reliability of the User Content or any other material or information that you may access through the
        Services. The Company assumes no responsibility for monitoring the Services for inappropriate submissions or
        conduct,
        but reserves the right to do so. If at any time the Company chooses, in its sole discretion, to monitor the
        Services, the Company nonetheless assumes no responsibility for the User Content, has no obligation to modify or
        remove
        any inappropriate User Content, and has no responsibility for the conduct of the Services users submitting any
        such User Content.</p>
      <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company and its designees shall have the right to remove any User Content at

        risks associated with, the use of any User Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or
        usefulness
        of such User Content. The Company may store User Content indefinitely. However, the Company has no obligation to
        store User Content or make it available to you in the future.</p>
      <p>You are solely responsible for your interactions with other Service users. The Company reserves the right, but
        has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other Service users. The Company reserves the right to
        terminate
        your Services access if the Company determines, in its sole discretion, that doing so is prudent.</p>
      <p>You may submit reviews or other feedback using forms on the Services. Any comments, suggestions, or feedback
        relating to the Services (collectively "Feedback") submitted to the Company shall become the property of the
        Company. The
        Company will not be required to treat any Feedback as confidential, and will not be liable for any ideas
        (including without limitation, product, application, site, Services or advertising ideas) and will not incur any
        liability
        as a result of any similarities that may appear in the Services, or operations, in the future. Without

        of every kind
        and nature everywhere and will be entitled to use the Feedback for any commercial or other purpose whatsoever,
