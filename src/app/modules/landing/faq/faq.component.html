                up each level the players will be awarded bonus virtual credits with the value getting progressively larger the higher the level attained. Players can also earn XP points for every game they play, so playing all the games on the
                site will earn the player more XP points.</p> <a href= "javascript:void(0)" class= "d-block">Back to top</a> </div></div>
