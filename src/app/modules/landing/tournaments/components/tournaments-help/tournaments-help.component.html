    <p>Slot Tournaments is a new type of tournament game that allows you – the player – the ability to enter a\r\n tournament, set a score and compete for prizes against other players on the site.<br><br>\r\n \r\n All tournaments accept up to ten players
        per tournament, with all players contributing their entry fee into the\r\n prize pool, which is then split between the top three scorers. Each player has up to 30 minutes to set their\r\n score, with all spins being of the same value and each
        player having the same number of spins. The winner is\r\n defined by the score that is generated based on the amount of virtual credits won as part of the\r\n tournament.<br><br>\r\n \r\n Once you log in and click the TOURNAMENTS link in the navigation
        at the top of the screen, you will be shown the\r\n screen below with the types of tournament games that can be played as well as the entry cost and total prize\r\n pool offered. Just select one of the tournament type options to see the individual
        tournaments of that type.</p>\r\n <img src=\ "assets/img/tournament-help_1.jpg\" alt=\ "\" class=\ "img-fluid\">\r\n \r\n
    <p>Once the type of tournament has been chosen, you will be shown the individual tournaments available to play in\r\n on the Tournaments Available page. There can be multiple tournaments of a specific tournament type available at\r\n any time, to allow
        players to choose the tournament based on how many other players have already entered, or\r\n enter multiple tournaments of the same type at one time. On this page you can also see the tournaments you have\r\n already played in. If for any reason
        you exited a tournament game while in play then as long as you are still\r\n within the 30 minutes play time, you can re-launch and continue playing in the tournament, by choosing the\r\n Launch button.</p>\r\n <img src=\
        "assets/img/tournament-help_2.jpg\" alt=\ "\" class=\ "img-fluid\">\r\n \r\n
    <p>When you have chosen the tournament you wish to enter, you will be shown the full details of that tournament on\r\n the Tournament Details page. Join the tournament by pressing the Enter button. This page also shows you how many\r\n other players
        have already entered the tournament and the prize table available as part of this tournament. If\r\n you do not have enough credit you will be alerted at this point that you need to buy more credits to play. Once\r\n you have pressed Enter the
        excitement starts and the tournament game is initiated and loads in the page along\r\n with the tournament leaderboard.</p>\r\n <img src=\ "assets/img/tournament-help_3.jpg\" alt=\ "\" class=\ "img-fluid\">\r\n \r\n
    <p>The Tournament Game page is where you will spend the most time and where the real competition begins. The game\r\n loads in the page and you can then start playing the game to try and win as much as you can with the balance of\r\n funds available.
        You can only play at a set stake amount and every player is given the same virtual credits to\r\n play so that everyone has the same chance to set the best score. As you play, the score is regularly updated in\r\n the top of the screen. Keep an
        eye on the clock as the timer counts down the time remaining to set your score.\r\n Every 30 seconds the leaderboard at the bottom of the screen will update and show you your rank against other\r\n players in the tournament. These players may
        be also playing or have already set their score, but once you\r\n complete all your games/spins then the score will be submitted and then once all ten players have set their\r\n scores then the tournament will complete and all prizes will be awarded.</p>\r\n

    <p>You can then check the details of the tournament in the Tournament History page, which can be found by clicking\r\n the large yellow button on the first tournament screen, accessed via the TOURNAMENTS link in the top navigation.\r\n </p>\r\n
